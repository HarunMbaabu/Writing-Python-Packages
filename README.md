# Writing-Python-Packages

A few years back when I typed ~~~py pip install opencv-python~~~, a few seconds passed and something magical happened- I was able to use OpenCV; no need to build it from source, no compiler needed, it was definitely breathtaking. I could install any package I wanted and not worry about building it source/ installing or configuring the system variable.
