# Writing-Python-Packages

A few years back when I typed <code> py pip install flask </code> , a few seconds passed and something magical happened- I was able to use flask to build a web server; no need to build it from source, no compiler needed, it was definitely breathtaking. 
I could install any package I wanted and not worry about building it source/ installing or configuring the system variable.
